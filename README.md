#My Lab Notebook
*powered by IPython*

Since June 2013 I have been using [IPython](http://ipython.org/) as my lab notebook.

I have created a forward facing interface that captures my research activity including notebooks rendered with nbviewer at <http://sr320.tumblr.com>

Browse all ipynb files via nbviewer at
