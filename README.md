###About
Since June 2013 I have been experimenting with [IPython](http://ipython.org/) as my lab notebook. This page is meant to serve as the forward facing access portal for the public (those not interested in the .pynb files). Anyone can download all the files ([zip file](https://github.com/sr320/ipython_nb/zipball/master), [project on GitHub](https://github.com/sr320/ipython_nb)) to view (and execute) in [IPython](http://ipython.org/). Below are links to some active project entries rendered in the [IPython Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
