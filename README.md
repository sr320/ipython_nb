###About
Since June 2013 I have been experimenting with IPython as my lab notebook. This page is meant to serve as the forward facing access portal for public (those not interested in the .pynb files). Anyone can download all the files ([zip file](https://github.com/sr320/ipython_nb/zipball/master), [project on GitHub](https://github.com/sr320/ipython_nb)) to view (and execute) in IPython. Below are links to some active project entries rendered in the [IPython Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/)
