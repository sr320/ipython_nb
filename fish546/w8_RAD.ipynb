      "Restriction site associated DNA (RAD) marker libraries were constructed to identify diagnostic markers among cohorts. Genomic DNA was isolated separately from the gill tissue BARN (n=4) and MASH (n=4) clams using DNAzol (Molecular Research Center) as per manufacturers recommendations. Libraries were prepared as described by Miller et al 2007. Briefly samples (n=8) were digested Sbf-1 (New England Biolabs), then each hybridized with a unique barcode, and RAD adapters (PI and P2) were ligated on DNA fragments. Size selection of DNA fragments was achieved by running PCR on a 1% EZ gel (Invitrogen) with E-gel 1 kb Plus DNA ladder followed by purification using the MiniElute gel purification protocol. Subsequent library construction and sequencing was carried out by the University of Washington High Throughput Genomics Unit (HTGU) using the Illumina HiSeq2000 system.    \n",

SNP detection was carried out using the following parameters:  maximum gap and mismatch count = 2,  minimum average quality = 15, minimum central quality = 20, minimum coverage = 10, minimum variant frequency = 35% (Genomics Workbench 4.0; CLC Bio). \n",

All but one individuals (MASH) had between 2.4 and 4.7 millions reads. To assess overall genetic diversity between the populations, reads were characterized in silico for each cohort. A de novo assembly of BARN reads resulted in 4,491 contigs containing 543 putative SNPs [Additional File 1](http://aquacul4.fish.washington.edu/~steven/armina/BARN_RAD_SNPtable.txt). This corresponds to approximately 5.0 SNPs / 1kb.  Assembly of the MASH reads resulted in 9,824 contigs containing 1372 SNPs [Additional File 2](http://aquacul4.fish.washington.edu/~steven/armina/MASH_RAD_SNPtable.txt). For this MASH library this corresponds to approximately 5.8 SNPs / 1kb. \n",

The number of identical contigs for each library was 8606 and 4845 for MASH and BARN, respectively. Comparing these two sets of isotigs revealed 2090 analogous sequences across cohorts with 1945 identical matches. The remaining 145 putative SNPs thus provide diagnostic markers to distinguish strains based on the samples used here. Of the 145 corresponding contigs only one mapped back to the transcriptome and this transcript was not annotated.\n",
